# Smart Contract Audit — Learning Log

Public log of my journey into Web3 security. This repo includes:
- SWC vulnerability examples (vulnerable + fixed)
- Notes from real audits (Code4rena/OpenZeppelin/etc.)
- Tooling snippets (Slither, Foundry)

## Structure
- `/SWC/*` — one folder per SWC (e.g., SWC-101).
- `/Audits/*` — notes from real audits I read.
