# Smart Contract Audit — Learning Log

Public log of my journey into Web3 security. This repo includes:
- SWC vulnerability examples (vulnerable + fixed)
- Notes from real audits (Code4rena/OpenZeppelin/etc.)
- Tooling snippets (Slither, Foundry)

## Structure
- `/SWC/*` — one folder per SWC (e.g., SWC-101).
- `/Audits/*` — notes from real audits I read.

## Today’s Progress (14-08-2025)
- SWC-107 summary + examples in Remix.
- Tested examples using Slither.
- Read first high severity vulnerability for Blackhole audit — recorded 6-point finding breakdown.

## Next
- Add SWC-102.
- Run Slither on small public repos.
