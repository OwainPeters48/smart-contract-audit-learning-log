## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

Across all mock audits, I practice the following process:
- Scope & repo setup  
- Manual review of access control, state management, logic, external calls, and events  
- Static analysis with [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither)  
- Documentation of findings with severity, PoCs, and recommendations
