1.  It tracks liquidity in ‘s_poolAssets’ so withdrawals subtract from it and reflect the true pool balance.
2.  the bug is in ‘CollateralTracker.sol’ → withdraw() function.
3.  Root cause: Assets are subtracted from ‘s_poolAssets’ in an uncheckled block with no check to ensure ‘s_poolAssets .= assets’
4.  Why it’s a problem: If ‘s_poolAssets’ is low, subtraction can underflow, wrapping to a huge value.
5.  Fix: Add a check:
’if (assets > s_poolAssets) revert Errors.ExceedsMaximumRedemption();’
6.  Severity Reasoning: Classified Low because no funds can be stolen; only temporary disruption of withdrawal functionality.
