# Smart Contract Security â€“ Learning Log

This repository documents my ongoing learning in smart contract auditing and vulnerability research.  
It includes practical examples, summaries of common vulnerability patterns (SWC Registry), and notes from real-world audit reports.  

The goal is to build a clear, public record of my skills and experience for clients, employers, and fellow researchers.
