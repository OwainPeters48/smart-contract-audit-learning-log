# Cyfrin Updraft Audit Reports

This folder contains my progress and reports from working through the [Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io) smart contract auditing course.  
The aim is to build real audit experience by reviewing example contracts, writing reports, and documenting findings as I learn.
