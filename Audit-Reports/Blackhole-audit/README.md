# Blackhole Audit – Report Notes

This repository contains my personal rewrite of selected findings from the [Code4rena Blackhole audit contest](https://code4rena.com/contests).  
I used this exercise to **practice professional audit reporting** and improve how I communicate vulnerabilities clearly and consistently.  

## 📖 What’s Inside
- A structured report covering:
  - **2 High severity** findings  
  - **2 Medium severity** findings  
- Reformatted in the style of professional audit reports (Impact → PoC → Recommendation).  
- Additional notes on **Patterns to Watch For**, highlighting generalisable security lessons.  
- **Style Observations**, reflecting what I’ve learned from reading top-tier reports.

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this repo is not to provide a complete re-audit, but to:
- Practice rephrasing real audit findings in my own words.  
- Learn how to structure and present vulnerabilities for clients/teams.  
- Build a portfolio of **audit-style reports** to demonstrate skills in smart contract security.  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
These notes are educational and based on Code4rena’s public Blackhole contest report.  
They are **not an original audit** and should not be relied on for production security reviews.
