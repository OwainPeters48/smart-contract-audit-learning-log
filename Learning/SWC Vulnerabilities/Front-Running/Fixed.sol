/*
    What is happening here?
    - This DEX improves security by forcing buyers to include a "maxPrice"
      they are willing to pay (slippage protection).

    Why is this safer?
    - If attacker front-runs and increases the price,
      the victimâ€™s tx will revert if the price > maxPrice.
    - This prevents victims from being forced into bad trades.
    - It makes sandwich attacks much harder.

    Other mitigations (not shown in code):
    - Commit-reveal schemes (hide trade details until reveal).
    - Private mempool services (e.g., Flashbots).
    - Batch auctions (group orders together so no one can front-run).
