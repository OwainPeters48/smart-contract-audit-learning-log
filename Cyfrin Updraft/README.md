# Cyfrin Updraft Audit Reports  

This folder contains my progress and reports from working through the **Cyfrin Updraft smart contract auditing course**.  
The goal is to build real audit experience by reviewing example contracts, writing structured reports, and documenting findings as I learn.

### 2. PuppyRaffle Audit Report (Module 4)  
- **Target:** PuppyRaffle.sol  
- **Focus:** Larger guided audit exercise covering CEI, randomness, integer safety, and denial-of-service risks.  
- **Findings Summary:**  
  - High: Reentrancy in `refund`  
  - High: Weak randomness in `selectWinner`  
  - High: Integer overflow in `totalFees`  
  - Medium: DoS/gas scaling from duplicate checks  
  - Low: Ambiguous return in `getActivePlayerIndex`  
  - Informational/Gas: pragma versioning, CEI consistency, avoiding magic numbers

### 3. T-Swap Audit Report (Module 5)

Target: TSwapPool.sol, PoolFactory.sol
Focus: Advanced DEX-style audit exploring AMM integrity, fee miscalculations, slippage exploitation, and ERC20 compatibility edge cases.

Findings Summary:
High-Severity Highlights:
- Incorrect swap type used in sellPoolTokens, causing mispriced returns
- Critical miscalculation in fee logic results in overcharging
- Missing slippage check in swapExactOutput, exposing users to poor trades
- Invariant x*y=k broken by reward logic in _swap()
- Deadline parameter in deposit() is never enforced

Medium-Severity:
- Fee-on-transfer, rebase, and ERC777 tokens break invariant and pool assumptions
- Non-standard ERC20s lead to silent calculation mismatches

Low-Severity & Informational:
- Events misordered or missing indexed fields
- Incorrect return handling, unused errors, and symbolic naming inconsistencies
- Lack of basic input checks (e.g., zero addresses)

Includes:
- Full audit report (Markdown & PDF)
- Foundry-based proof-of-concept tests for every high/medium issue
- Recommended mitigations written in diff-style format
- Scope breakdown with CLOC metrics
- Clear impact analysis and fix strategies for every vulnerability
